# Old-School Snake

A classic Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game allows players to control a snake on a grid and collect fruits to increase their score. The game offers different difficulty levels and features a timer and lives system.

You can play the game [here](https://maxkovalski.github.io/Snake-Game/).

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat as many fruits as possible without colliding with walls or the snake's own body. The longer the snake becomes by eating fruits, the higher the score. The game ends when the snake hits a wall, collides with itself, or the timer runs out.

## Features

- Multiple game difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard.
- Timer: The game includes a timer that counts down based on the selected difficulty level.
- Lives: Players start with a certain number of lives, and each collision decreases the number of lives remaining.
- Score: The score increases as the snake eats fruits, with different fruits providing varying points.
- Sound Effects: The game includes sound effects for eating fruits and game over.

## How to Play

2. Select the desired difficulty level by clicking the corresponding button (easy, normal, hard).
3. The timer will start counting down once the game begins.
4. Move the snake to eat fruits and increase your score.
5. Avoid hitting walls or colliding with the snake's body.
6. The game ends when you lose all your lives or the timer reaches zero.
7. To restart the game, click the "RESTART" button.
